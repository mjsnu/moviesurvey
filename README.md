## Why do you conduct this research?
This study is based on the background of increasing cultural content consumption, importance of recommendation algorithm, and understanding of user preference in the multi-device environment.
1. Design survey items and interface to secure cultural preference data of users,
2. Through this, we collect and analyze user culture preference data to identify the significant factors necessary for the method of preference extraction.
3. The goal is to derive the interface design implications for the purpose by receiving feedback from the user about the preference extraction method.


## How many people are involved?
This study recruits a maximum of 1,000 participants. Participants are those who do not have difficulty in answering online surveys. There are no age, gender or occupational constraints (not directly related to the study). However, minors under 18 years old are not allowed to participate.

## What happens if I participate in the research?
If you indicate your intention to participate, the following process will be as follows.

1. You will participate in a survey and an optional second survey if you choose to participate. Both surveys are conducted online and through desktop computers and web browsers. The first survey will take 5~10 minutes, and the second survey will take in around 15 minutes.
2. 30 films were selected as cultural contents to be evaluated in the first survey. IMDB (https://www.imdb.com), a leading movie data provider, has collected movie data that has been rated by more than 100,000 movies in the last 10 years, making it a total of 250 movies. Among them, a total of 30 films were selected by random sampling according to the ratio of each rating section in consideration of the distribution of ratings of these films.
3. Here, the user is looking at how selection time influences the evaluation of the two options "like / dislike" and what the user's experience was during the evaluation. For each of the 30 movies, the user is asked to rate ‘like’ or ‘dislike’. The time is automatically recorded from the moment the user views the survey to the moment the response is completed. The participant will also be asked whether they have seen the movie, and also provide the confidence in their answer in a 5-point Likert scale. The participants will also get asked about their feedback on the survey design design. 30 movies are presented in a random order for each participant and performed on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform.
4. If you choose to participate in the follow-up survey, you will be asked to provide reasons for why you have given those ratings for questions that take longer than 1 standard deviation than their question completion average, they will be asked to provide the reason to why they have ‘liked’ or ‘disliked’ the movie. 

## How long do you have to participate in the study?
The survey will take about 10 minutes, regardless of the first and second survey.

## Can I quit while participating?
Yes, you may stop at any time during your participation without any penalty. If you want to stop participating in the study, tell your researcher or research director immediately. If you choose to stop participating in the survey, all data collected up to that point will be deleted and will not be included in the study analysis.

## Are there any side effects or risks?
Since this study is only a survey of cultural preference items (movies), there are no side effects or risk factors.

## Are there benefits to participants in participating in this study?
There is no direct benefit to your participation in this study. However, the information you provide will help to improve your understanding of taste determination.
